# ðŸ§© AR Puzzle Experiment for Chemistry Learning

This project helps students **learn chemistry experiments** in a fun and interactive way using **Augmented Reality (AR)**.

---

## ðŸŒŸ What It Does

- Students first **solve a jigsaw puzzle** made from a chemistry experiment image (like distillation, titration, or crystallization).  
- After completing the puzzle, they **scan it using their smartphone camera**.  
- A **video of the experiment** appears right on the puzzle, showing step-by-step procedures and results.  

This makes learning **safe, visual, and engaging**, even without a real lab.
