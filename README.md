🧩 AR Puzzle Experiment for Chemistry Learning This project helps students learn chemistry experiments in a fun and interactive way using Augmented Reality (AR).

🌟 What It Does Students first solve a jigsaw puzzle made from a chemistry experiment image (like distillation, titration, or crystallization). After completing the puzzle, they scan it using their smartphone camera. A video of the experiment appears right on the puzzle, showing step-by-step procedures and results. This makes learning safe, visual, and engaging, even without a real lab.

🎯 Why It’s Useful 🔬 Understand setups clearly 🎥 Watch the experiment in AR 🧠 Learn by doing (puzzle + video) 🧱 Safe for school or home study
